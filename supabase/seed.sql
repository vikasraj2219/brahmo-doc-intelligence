('C-012', 'CONSTRAINT', 'IP Assignment Carve-Out',

('C-013', 'CONSTRAINT', 'Arbitration Clause',

('D-010', 'DECISION', 'Return of Materials',
 'TechCorp NDA (2026): Client lost trade secret protection because NDA had no return of materials clause. Now MANDATORY: every NDA must include return/destruction of confidential materials on termination.',
